# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my first Python projects and exercises.
Each file represents a small challenge I solved while learning loops, conditions, and basic logic.

## Topics Covered
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Conditionals (`if/elif/else`)
- Basic arithmetic and data analysis
